    <ul> The Best Kinds of Trout
    <li class="trout-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_trout" target="_blank">Rainbow</a> </li>
    <p> The rainbow trout is native only to the rivers and lakes of North America, west of the Rocky Mountains, but its value as a hard-fighting game fish and tasty meal has led to its introduction throughout the world. </p>
    <li class="trout-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_trout" target="_blank">Brook</a></li>
    <p>  Brook trout prefer small spring fed streams and ponds with sand or gravel bottom and vegetation. This species prefers to spawn over gravel in either streams or lakes, with ground water percolation or in the spring fed areas in lakes. </p>
    <li class="trout-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_trout" target="_blank">Tiger</a></li>
    <p> Tiger trout are a hybrid between a female brown trout and a male brook trout. They are greenish yellow to brown with dark patches along their sides creating a maze-like pattern. Their belly is yellowish orange and the tail fin is square. </p>
    <li class="trout-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_trout" target="_blank">Brown</a></li>
    <p> Brown trout are tawny to olive brown dorsally to mid side, often with a brassy appearance. Sides grade from tan to yellow. Their back and sides are marked with olive brown to black spots. Their sides also marked with orange to red spots, some haloed with white to pale blue. Their undersides, including the lower jaw, are white to pearl. The dorsal fin is typically yellow-olive, marked with brown to black spots. Lower fins including the pectoral, pelvic and anal have white margins, paralleled just above by a dark zone and are otherwise yellow-olive to amber, sometimes yellow orange.
    </p>
    <li class="trout-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroat_trout">Cutthroat</a></li>
    <p> The Cutthroat trout evolved into its current form in the Western United States in a rugged mountainous terrain. This terrain kept individual “pods” of cutthroats in isolated areas, and their gene pools limited from encounters with various other trout during their evolution. This led to many different separately evolved sub species of the cutthroat. Divided by large mountains and drainage’s, each sub species took on their own coloration, habits and traits.
